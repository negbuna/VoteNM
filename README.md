VoteNM
---
A web app built with Next.js which allows people to submit applications for absentee ballots in the state of New Mexico. Someone who wants an absentee ballot can complete a web form, and [VoteNM](https://votenm.vercel.app) will use their input to complete the state-sanctioned PDF and email it to the state registrar of their locality. The current demo allows users to download their completed absentee form and shows the local registrar that the form would be sent to in deployment.

Anyone registered to vote in New Mexico may request an absentee ballot under the authority of the 1993 [House Bill 4 of the New Mexico Voting Rights Act](https://www.nmlegis.gov). Absentee ballot request forms may be submitted electronically in New Mexico under the authority of the 2023 [Senate Bill 8 of the New Mexico Voting Rights Act](https://www.governor.state.nm.us/2022/01/25/governor-secretary-of-state-introduce-new-mexico-voting-rights-act/).
