VoteNM
---
A web app built with Next.js which allows users to submit applications for absentee ballots in the state of New Mexico. Somebody who wants an absentee ballot can complete a web form, and [VoteNM](https://github.com/negbuna/VoteNM) will use their input to complete the state-sanctioned PDF and email it to the state registrar of their locality. VoteNM is based off of and expands upon eAbsentee, an  online absentee ballot application in Virginia.

Absentee ballot request forms may be submitted electronically in New Mexico under the authority of the 1993 [House Bill 4 of the New Mexico Voting Rights Act](https://www.nmlegis.gov).
